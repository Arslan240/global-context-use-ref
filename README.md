# App Using Global Context and useRef

- It uses Global Context in AppContext, from which provider is exported by default and the useGlobalContext custom hook is exported by name.
- useGlobalContext hook returns the GlobalContext which can be later used in other components.
- useRef hook refers to name input in AddUser, and on load it focuses that element to make it more usable.
